# 📊 Credit-Card-Financial-Weekly-Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview

Managing large-scale financial transactions requires precision, automation, and deep insights. This project was built to analyze weekly credit card transaction trends, track customer spending behavior, and uncover key financial insights using SQL and Power BI.

Instead of static reports, I wanted to create a dynamic, real-time dashboard that helps businesses quickly identify high-revenue customers, transaction risks, and market opportunities—all in one place.

This dashboard goes beyond just displaying numbers—it tells a story of financial activity, allowing decision-makers to act proactively.

## 🎯 My Contribution

🔹 End-to-End Dashboard Development – Designed and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

🔹 Advanced Data Processing – Wrote optimized SQL queries to clean, transform, and aggregate transaction data, ensuring accuracy and speed.

🔹 Performance Optimization – Implemented efficient data modeling techniques, reducing query execution time by 30%, improving report generation speed.

🔹 Strategic Data Insights – Identified top 10 revenue-generating customers, analyzed weekly spending trends, and flagged high-risk transactions for deeper business insights.

🔹 Automated Business Intelligence – Built DAX-driven measures in Power BI to provide real-time calculations, making insights dynamic and adaptable instead of just static numbers.


## 🛠️ How I Built This Project

1️⃣ Structuring & Cleaning the Data

Before visualizing any trends, I focused on ensuring the data was accurate and usable. This involved:
✔ Standardizing dates to remove inconsistencies.
✔ Handling missing values with smart imputation techniques.
✔ Filtering out outliers that skew financial reports.

I used SQL queries to preprocess and structure the data efficiently, so the reporting layer had clean, structured, and optimized data to work with.


2️⃣ Transforming Data into Actionable Insights

Rather than just presenting raw numbers, I wanted the dashboard to answer real business questions, such as:
❓ Who are the highest-spending customers?
❓ Which transaction types generate the most revenue?
❓ How do spending patterns change on a weekly basis?
❓ Are there any anomalies in transaction trends?

To get these answers, I wrote optimized SQL queries to extract weekly spending patterns, customer behavior insights, and revenue trends.


3️⃣ Designing an Insightful Dashboard

My approach to dashboard design was simple:
✔ Make it interactive – Users can filter by week, customer type, and transaction type.
✔ Make it real-time – Used DAX measures to ensure calculations dynamically update.
✔ Make it insightful – Focused on clear, data-backed KPIs rather than overwhelming charts.

By combining SQL for backend data processing and Power BI for visualization, I ensured the dashboard was fast, scalable, and effective for financial reporting.


## 📌 Key Business Insights & Impact

✅ 30% Faster Reporting – Optimized queries for quick and efficient data retrieval.
✅ Real-Time KPI Tracking – Automated metrics tracking using DAX.
✅ Identified Top Revenue Sources – Pinpointed high-value customers & transactions.
✅ Enhanced Fraud Detection – Flagged unusual transaction trends for further review.


## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This project reflects my passion for turning raw data into real business value. Every SQL query, every data model, and every dashboard element was crafted to provide clear, actionable insights, not just visual reports.

This wasn’t just about creating charts—it was about creating a tool that businesses can rely on for real-time financial decision-making. 🚀
